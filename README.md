# Lab 3 - React Notes
## CS52 Spring 2021, Derek Lu

This web app allows one to create draggable, editable, and resizable sticky notes that can be viewed and 
manipulated by any user on the application.

## What Worked Well
Overall, the management and use of React components worked well and solidified my knowledge of how components,
state, and props work.

The implementation of basic note functions went smoothly, much to my surprise.

## What Didn't
Using some libraries like react-resizable proved to be rather annoying, given that I wasn't sure what was going wrong and had
to do quite a bit of digging until I found the right documentation or answer.

## Extra Credit

My notes can be resizable (though this is a little bit buggy).

My notes can be reordered.

My notes can be organized.
